natively multi-homed architecture
multihoming = a computer connected to more than one network
consistency in the presence of datacenter level outages

Challenges in building multi-homed system
1. Synchronous global state
2. what to checkpoint
3. repeatable input
4. exactly once input

failover
deployment of stand-by resources
