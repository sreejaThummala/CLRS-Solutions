/**
You are given a set of consumers ( x - coordinates)
You are given a set of producer ( (x,y) )
Assume all the sets are sorted by x.
Find for each consumer, its nearest producer.
Needs an O(n) solution. linear in both producers and consumers 
**/
Iterate over producers. 
Strategy # 1: 
1. Simplify the problem.
2. Remove the y coordinates.
3. How to solve the problem if both are just x coordinates
  1.1 Dequeue 
        keep on popping the producers till we get one which is greater than consumer
        compare it with just less and just greater - take which is nearer to it
4. Add the second dimension to the producer coordinates
  1.1 We cannot pop the producers based on just x coordinates
      we need to queue the producers based on who is nearer to a X point at a time. 
      1.1.1 This can be done by making sure in dequeue present element is not nearer to previous elements x coordinate than itself.
  and use the above x coordinate algorithm.
